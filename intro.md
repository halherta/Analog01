# Introduction to Analog Circuits I

## Course Description

This course introduces fundamental laws and principles in electronic
circuits such as Ohm\'s and Kirchhoff\'s laws; Thevenin, Norton and
superposition Theorems; the voltage and current divider rules. Student
will examine these in a practical environment through experimentation.

In this course the following topics will be covered:

-   Scientific and engineering notation & SI Units
-   Basic quantities and circuit elements
-   Ohm\'s law
-   Kirchhoff\'s laws
-   Series and parallel circuits
-   Series-parallel and complex circuits
-   Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits
-   Theorem of superposition
-   Nodal & loop analysis
-   Introduction to operational amplifiers (op-amps)
-   Fundamental op-amp circuits
