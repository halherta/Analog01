## Thevenin's Theorem

Thevenin\'s theorem states that *any linear circuit containing one or
more voltage and/or current sources and resistances can be replaced by a
single Thevenin voltage source* $V_{TH}$ *in series with a single
Thevenin resistor* $R_{TH}$.

The procedure to calculate $V_{TH}$ and $R_{TH}$ for a given circuit is
as follows:

-   To calculate $R_{TH}$:

    > 1.  replace all sources with their ideal source resistances
    >
    >     > a.  Replace each current source in the circuit with an open
    >     >     circuit
    >     > b.  Replace each voltage source in the circuit with a short
    >     >     circuit
    >
    > 2.  Remove the load resistance from the output terminals and
    >     calculate the circuit resistance looking in through output
    >     terminals. This resistance is $R_{TH}$.

-   To calculate $V_{TH}$:

    > 1.  Remove the load resistance, leaving an open circuit across the
    >     output terminals.
    > 2.  Calculate the voltage across the output terminals. This
    >     voltage will be $V_{TH}$.

This method is best shown by an example.

### Example 1

Find the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in the above
schematic.

**Solution**

![](../_static/images/advanced01/thev01.png){.align-center
width="75.0%"}

To solve for $V_{TH}$ first remove the load resistance. Then calculate
the voltage across the output terminals. Because the output terminals
are open, no current flows through $R_3$, therefore there\'s no voltage
drop across it. This means that the voltage at the output terminals
($V_{TH}$) is also across $R_2$. In this particular scenario,

$$V_{TH} = V_S \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = 6V \cdot \frac{220 \Omega}{220 \Omega + 560 \Omega} = 1.692V$$

To calculate $R_{TH}$, replace the voltage source with a short, remove
the load resistance and calculate the resistance of the circuit looking
into the load terminals

$$R_{TH} = (R1 // R2) + R3 = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{ R_1 + R_2} + R_3 =\frac{560\Omega \cdot 220\Omega}{ 560\Omega + 220\Omega} + 330\Omega = 487.948\Omega$$

Therefore the Thevenin equivalent circuit is:

To verify that the Thevenin equivalent is indeed the same as the
original circuit, place the same load resistance across the load
terminals of both circuits and calculate $V_{RL}$ and $I_{RL}$. If they
are the same in both circuits then the circuits are indeed identical.
This can be easily accomplished with a circuit simulator as shown below:

### Example 2

Find the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in the schematic
below.

![](../_static/images/advanced01/thev03.png){.align-center
width="70.0%"}

**Solution**

![](../_static/images/advanced01/thev04.png){.align-center
width="100.0%"}

To solve for $V_{TH}$ first remove the load resistance. Then calculate
the voltage across the output terminals. Because the output terminals
are open, no current flows through $R_5$, therefore there\'s no voltage
drop across it. This means that the voltage at the output terminals
($V_{TH}$) is also across $R_4$. In this particular scenario, In order
to calculate $V_{TH}$, $V_{A}$ will have to be calculated first.

![](../_static/images/advanced01/thev05.png){.align-center
width="100.0%"}

To solve for $V_{A}$, find the equivalent resistance of resistances
$R_2$, $R_3$ & $R_4$, compressing the circuit into a series circuit;
then use a voltage divider to solve for $V_A$

$$R_{{EQ}_1} = R_2 // (R_3 + R_4) = \frac{ 330 \cdot 1430}{ 330 + 1430 } = 268.125\Omega$$

$$V_A = V_{S1} \cdot \frac{  R_{{EQ}_1}}{  R_{{EQ}_1} + R_1} = 6V \cdot \frac{268.125\Omega}{268.125\Omega + 100\Omega} =  4.370V$$

Since the branch containing resistors $R_3$ & $R_4$ is in parallel with
$R_2$ it can be modeled as an independent series circuit with a voltage
source of $V_A$. Another voltage divider can be then used to solve for
$V_{TH}$\`:

$$V_{TH} = V_A \cdot \frac{R_4}{R_3 + R_4} = 4.370V \cdot \frac{870\Omega}{560\Omega + 870\Omega} = 2.659V$$

Solving for $R_{TH}$ involves replacing the voltage source with a short
circuit, removing the load resistor and calculating the overall
equivalent resistance of the circuit looking into the output terminals.

$$R_{TH} = (((R_1 // R_2) + R_3) // R4) + R_5 = 1367.659\Omega$$

Therefore the Thevenin equivalent circuit is:

![](../_static/images/advanced01/thev06.png){.align-center
width="50.0%"}

To verify this, simulate both the original and Thevenin equivalent
circuits; setting the load resistance in both circuits to the same
value, say 1kÎ©, then take note of the voltage across the load $V_{RL}$
and the current passing through the load $I_{RL}$. They should be the
same in both circuits.

## Norton\'s theorem

Norton\'s theorem states that *any linear circuit containing one or more
voltage and/or current sources and resistances can be replaced by a
single Norton current source* $I_{N}$ *in parallel with a single Norton
resistor* $R_{N}$.

![](../_static/images/advanced01/norton01.png){.align-center
width="75.0%"}

The procedure to calculate $I_{N}$ and $R_{N}$ for a given circuit is as
follows:

-   The procedure for calculating the Norton resistance $R_{N}$ is
    basically the same as the procedure for calculating the Thevenin
    resistance $R_{TH}$ :

    > 1.  replace all sources with their ideal source resistances
    >
    >     > a.  Replace each current source in the circuit with an open
    >     >     circuit
    >     > b.  Replace each voltage source in the circuit with a short
    >     >     circuit
    >
    > 2.  Remove the load resistance from the output terminals and
    >     calculate the circuit resistance looking in through output
    >     terminals. This resistance is $R_{TH}$.

-   To calculate $I_{N}$:

    > 1.  Replace the load resistance with a wire (or short).
    > 2.  Calculate the current flowing through that wire. This current
    >     is the Norton current $I_{N}$

### Example 3

Find the Norton equivalent of the circuit shown in the schematic below.

![](../_static/images/advanced01/norton02.png){.align-center
width="75.0%"}

To solve for $I_{N}$ replace the load resistance with a wire. Then
calculate the current $I_N$ flowing through that wire.

Since this is a series parallel circuit, node voltage $V_A$ must be
found first. Compress $R_2$ and $R_3$ into a single equivalent
resistance as shown in the figure below:

![](../_static/images/advanced01/norton03.png){.align-center
width="75.0%"}

$$R_2 // R_3 = \frac{R_2 \cdot R_3}{R_2 + R_3} = \frac{220 \Omega \cdot 330 \Omega }{220 \Omega + 330 \Omega} = 132 \Omega$$

$V_A$ can now be calculated using a simple voltage divider:

$$V_A = V_S \cdot \frac{R_2 // R_3}{ (R_2 // R_3)  + R_1} = 6 \cdot \frac{132 \Omega}{ (132 \Omega)  + 560 \Omega } = 1.145V$$

Knowing $V_A$, $I_N$ can be calculated as:

$$I_N = \frac{V_A}{R_3} = \frac{1.145V}{330 \Omega} = 3.470mA$$

To calculate $R_{N}$, replace the voltage source with a short, remove
the load resistance and calculate the resistance of the circuit looking
into the load terminals. This is the same procedure as for calculating
$R_{TH}$, so $R_{N}$ has to be equal to $R_{TH}$ in example 1.

> $$R_{N} = (R1 // R2) + R3 = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{ R_1 + R_2} + R_3 =\frac{560\Omega \cdot 220\Omega}{ 560\Omega + 220\Omega} + 330\Omega = 487.948\Omega$$

Therefore the Norton equivalent circuit is:

![](../_static/images/advanced01/norton04.png){.align-center
width="50.0%"}

To verify that the Norton equivalent is indeed the same as the original
circuit, place the same load resistance across the load terminals of
both circuits and calculate $V_{RL}$ and $I_{RL}$. If they are the same
in both circuits then the circuits are indeed identical. This can be

## Converting Thevenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits using Source Conversions

Since Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits have the same topology as
practical voltage and current sources respectively, source conversions
can be performed on either circuit to convert it to the other.

When converting a Thevenin circuit to its equivalent Norton circuit, the
Norton current and resistance can be calculated as follows:

$$I_N = \frac{V_{TH}}{R_{TH}}$$

$$R_N = R_{TH}$$

When converting a Norton circuit to its equivalent Thevenin circuit, the
Thevenin voltage and resistance can be calculated as follows:

$$V_{TH} = I_N \cdot R_N$$

$$R_{TH} = R_{N}$$

width="50.0%"}

### Example 4

In examples 1 and 3, the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits where
derived independently.

a.  Convert the independently derived Thevenin equivalent circuit to a
    Norton equivalent circuit using source conversions. Is it identical
    to the independently derived Norton circuit?
b.  Convert the independently derived Norton equivalent circuit to a
    Thevenin equivalent circuit using source conversions. Is it
    identical to the independently derived Thevenin circuit?

![](../_static/images/advanced01/source_conv02.png){.align-center
width="50.0%"}

**Solution**

a.  Converting a Thevenin circuit to its equivalent Norton circuit:

$$I_N = \frac{V_{TH}}{R_{TH}} =  \frac{1.692V}{487.948\Omega} = 3.468mA$$

$$R_N = R_{TH} = 487.948\Omega$$

The Norton current $I_N$ and Norton resistance $R_N$ derived from source
converting the Thevenin circuit are equivalent to the Norton current
$I_N$ and Norton resistance $R_N$ values derived independently.

b.  Converting a Norton circuit to its equivalent Thevenin circuit:

$$V_{TH} = I_N \cdot R_N  = 3.470mA \cdot 487.948\Omega = 1.701V$$

$$R_{TH} = R_{N} = 487.948\Omega$$

The Norton current $I_N$ and Norton resistance $R_N$ derived from source
converting the Thevenin circuit are equivalent to the Norton current
$I_N$ and Norton resistance $R_N$ values derived independently.

## The Principle of Superposition

The principle of superposition is typically used to help analyze
circuits with two or more power sources. This principle states: *The
total current in any part of a linear circuit equals the algebraic sum
of the currents produced by each source separately.*

To solve a circuit using superposition, the first step is to turn off or
suppress all but one power source.

-   To suppress a voltage source, replace it with a short circuit (ideal
    source resistance).
-   To suppress a current source, replace it with an open circuit (ideal
    source resistance).

Then analyze the resulting simpler circuits. Repeat for all inputs. The
final result is the sum of individual results.

Consider the circuit with two voltage sources shown in the figure below:

![](../_static/images/advanced01/super01.png){.align-center
width="50.0%"}

To solve for $V_A$, first replace $V_{S2}$ with a short and analyze the
circuit with only supply $V_{S1}$, to solve for $V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$. Then
replace $V_{S1}$ with a short and analyze the circuit again with only
supply $V_{S2}$ to solve for $V_{A_{V_{S2}}}$. Finally add (or
superpose) $V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$ and $V_{A_{V_{S2}}}$ to solve for $V_A$ in
the original circuit.

$$V_{A} = V_{A_{V_{S1}}} + V_{A_{V_{S2}}}$$

### Example 5

Find the node voltage $V_A$ in the circuit shown above:

**Solution**

![](../_static/images/advanced01/super02.png){.align-center
width="85.0%"}

The first step is replace $V_{S2}$ with a short and analyze the circuit
with only $V_{S1}$ to determine $V_A$ due to only $V_{S1}$ :
$V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$. Because $V_{S2}$ is replaced with a short, resistors
$R_2$ and $R_3$ are in parallel. They can be compressed into a single
equivalent resistance $R_2 // R_3$, which reduces the circuit to a
series circuit. Now $V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$ is simply the voltage across
$R_2 // R_3$ and can be calculated with a simple voltage divider.

$$R_2 // R_3 = \frac{R_2 \cdot R_3}{ R_2 + R_3} = \frac{4.7k\Omega \cdot 2.2k\Omega }{ 4.7k\Omega  + 2.2k\Omega} = 1498.551 \Omega$$

$$V_{A_{V_{S1}}} = V_{S1} \cdot \frac{R_2 // R_3}{\left(R_2 // R_3 \right) + R_1}  =  8V \cdot \frac{1498.551 \Omega}{1498.551 \Omega + 1k\Omega} = 4.798 V$$

Next replace $V_{S1}$ with a short and analyze the circuit with only
$V_{S2}$ to determine $V_A$ due to only $V_{S2}$ : $V_{A_{V_{S2}}}$.
Because $V_{S1}$ is replaced with a short, resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are
in parallel. They can be compressed into a single equivalent resistance
$R_1 // R_2$, which reduces the circuit to a series circuit. Now
$V_{A_{V_{S2}}}$ is simply the voltage across $R_1 // R_2$ and can be
calculated with a simple voltage divider.

$$R_1 // R_2 = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_3}{ R_1 + R_3} = \frac{1k\Omega \cdot 4.7k\Omega }{ 1k\Omega  + 4.7k\Omega} = 824.561 \Omega$$

$$V_{A_{V_{S2}}} = V_{S2} \cdot \frac{R_1 // R_2}{\left(R_1 // R_2 \right) + R_3}  =  12V \cdot \frac{824.561 \Omega}{824.561 \Omega + 2.2k\Omega} = 3.271 V$$

Now to solve for the true $V_A$ in the original circuit with both power
sources $V_{S1}$ and $V_{S2}$ :

$$V_{A} = V_{A_{V_{S1}}} + V_{A_{V_{S2}}} = 4.798 V + 3.271 V = 8.069 V$$

This result can be easily verified with simulation:

### Example 6

Solve for voltage $V_A$ in the circuit shown below:

![](../_static/images/advanced01/super03.png){.align-center
width="50.0%"}

**Solution**

![](../_static/images/advanced01/super04.png){.align-center
width="85.0%"}

The first step is replace $I_{S1}$ with an **open** and analyze the
circuit with only $V_{S1}$ to determine $V_A$ due to only $V_{S1}$ :
$V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$. Because $I_{S1}$ is replaced with an open, resistor
$R_3$ has no current flowing through it nor voltage drop across it and
can be discarded leaving a simple series circuit with only $V_{S1}$,
$R_1$ and $R_2$. $V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$ is simply the voltage across $R_2$ and
can be calculated with a simple voltage divider.

$$V_{A_{V_{S1}}} = V_{S1} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_2 + R_1}  =  6V \cdot \frac{1k\Omega}{3.3k\Omega + 1k\Omega} = 1.395 V$$

Next replace $V_{S1}$ with a short and analyze the circuit with only
$I_{S1}$ to determine $V_A$ due to only $1_{S1}$ : $V_{A_{I_{S1}}}$.
Because $V_{S1}$ is replaced with a short, resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are
in parallel. They can be compressed into a single equivalent resistance
$R_1 // R_2$, which reduces the circuit to a series circuit with a
current $I_{S1}$ flowing through all components. $V_{A_{I_{S1}}}$ is the
voltage across $R_1 // R_2$ and can be calculated via Ohm\'s law i.e.
multiplying current $I_{S1}$ with resistance $R_1 // R_2$.

$$R_1 // R_2 = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{ R_1 + R_2} = \frac{3.3k\Omega \cdot 1k\Omega }{ 3.3k\Omega  + 1k\Omega} = 767.442 \Omega$$

$$V_{A_{I_{S1}}} = I_{S1} \cdot (R_1 // R_2)  =  8mA \cdot 767.442 \Omega = 6.140 V$$

Now to solve for the true $V_A$ in the original circuit with both power
sources $V_{S1}$ and $V_{S2}$ :

$$V_{A} = V_{A_{V_{S1}}} + V_{A_{I_{S1}}} = 1.395 V + 6.140 V = 7.535V$$

This result can be verified with simulation:

### Example 7

Find node voltages $V_A$ & $V_B$ in the circuit shown below:

![](../_static/images/advanced01/super05.png){.align-center
width="60.0%"}

**Solution**

First replace $V_{S2}$ with a short $I_{S1}$ with and open to analyze
the circuit with voltage source $V_{S1}$. Now find $V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$ and
$V_{B_{V_{S1}}}$. The circuit is now broken into two simpler circuits.

![](../_static/images/advanced01/super06.png){.align-center
width="60.0%"}

The one on the right (with branches containing resistors $R_3$ and
$R_4$) has no power source in it and therefore:

$$V_{B_{V_{S1}}} = 0V$$

The circuit on the left is a simple series circuit. $V_{A_{V_{S1}}}$ can
be found with a simple voltage divider:

$$V_{A_{V_{S1}}} = V_{S1} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = 6V \cdot \frac{470\Omega}{100\Omega + 470\Omega} = 4.947V$$

Next replace $V_{S1}$ with a short $I_{S1}$ with and open to analyze the
circuit with voltage source $V_{S2}$. Now find $V_{A_{V_{S2}}}$ and
$V_{B_{V_{S2}}}$. The circuit is again broken into two simpler circuits.

![](../_static/images/advanced01/super07.png){.align-center
width="60.0%"}

The one on the left (with branches containing resistors $R_1$ and $R_1$)
has no power source in it and therefore:

$$V_{A_{V_{S2}}} = 0V$$

The circuit on the right is a simple series circuit. $V_{B_{V_{S2}}}$
can be found with a simple voltage divider:

$$V_{B_{V_{S2}}} = V_{S2} \cdot \frac{R_3}{R_3 + R_4} = 4V \cdot \frac{470\Omega}{470\Omega + 220\Omega} = 2.725V$$

Finally replace both $V_{S1}$ and $V_{S2}$ with shorts $I_{S1}$ to
analyze the circuit with current source $I_{S1}$. Now find
$V_{A_{I_{S1}}}$ and $V_{B_{I_{S1}}}$.

First notice that resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in parallel and that
resistors $R_3$ and $R_4$ are also in parallel. Finding their equivalent
resistances $R_1 // R_2$ & $R_3 // R_4$ we get:

$$R_1 // R_2 = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{100\Omega \cdot 470\Omega }{ 100\Omega  + 470\Omega} = 82.456 \Omega$$

$$R_3 // R_4 = \frac{R_3 \cdot R_4}{R_3 + R_4} = \frac{470\Omega \cdot 220\Omega }{ 470\Omega  + 220\Omega} = 149.855 \Omega$$

Compressing these parallel resistances, reduces the circuit to a series
circuit. However take note of the position of the reference ground
terminal. Note how the node voltage $V_{A_{I_{S1}}}$ is below the ground
point implying that it is a negative voltage.

$$V_{B_{I_{S1}}} = I_{S1} * (R_3 // R_4) = 8mA \cdot 149.855 \Omega = 1.199V$$

$$V_{A_{I_{S1}}} = -I_{S1} * (R_3 // R_4) = -8mA \cdot 82.456 \Omega = -0.660V$$

Now to solve for the true $V_A$ and $V_B$ in the original circuit with
all power sources $V_{S1}$, $V_{S2}$ and $I_{S1}$ :

$$V_{A} = V_{A_{V_{S1}}} + V_{A_{V_{S2}}} + V_{A_{I_{S1}}} = 4.947V + 0V + -0.660V = 4.287V$$

$$V_{B} = V_{B_{V_{S1}}} + V_{B_{V_{S2}}} + V_{B_{I_{S1}}} = 0V + 2.725V + 1.199V = 3.924V$$

This result can be verified with simulation:
